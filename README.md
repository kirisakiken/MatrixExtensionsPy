# Matrix Operations Library for Python

---

Library has basic `matrix` and `vector` operations available for 2D and 3D
spaces. To use the library in external projects. Either pull project files
into your repositroy, or reference it via `setup.py` or `requirements.txt`
file.

### Supported Types;
1. [x] `Vector2 -- [x, y]`
2. [x] `Vector3 -- [x, y, z]`
3. [ ] `Vector4 -- [x, y, z, w]`
4. [ ] `Quaternion -- [x, y, z, w]`

### Supported Operations;
1. [x] `Transform in 2D/3D`
2. [x] `Translation in 2D/3D`
3. [x] `Rotation in 2D/3D`
4. [x] `Scale in 2D/3D`
